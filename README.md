# DarijaSpeechToSrtVideo

Inspired by Marouane53, this project is a simple script that uses the Wit API to transcribe Arabic (Darija) to SRT. It utilizes the "tafrigh" library to generate Arabic subtitles (SRT) and outputs them onto the video you downloaded.

## Prerequisites

1. Install the required packages by running:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
2. Obtain a Wit.ai Arabic API key:
        Create an account on Wit.ai.
        Once logged in, create a new app.
        Select Arabic as the app's language.
        Go to the app's settings and navigate to the "Management" section.
        You will find the "Server Access Token" there, which serves as your API key.

##Running the script

To run the script, use:
   ```bash
    python test.py
